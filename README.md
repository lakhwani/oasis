# Disaster Relief Crowdfunding

## Overview

Disaster Relief Crowdfunding is a compassionate and innovative platform dedicated to providing timely and targeted financial assistance for disaster relief efforts. This platform uniquely integrates Chainlink oracles with Ambee’s disaster relief API to release funds based on verified real-world triggers, such as natural disasters.

## Description

In the face of increasing climate-related disasters, the urgency for an efficient and transparent aid distribution system has never been greater. Our platform addresses this need by ensuring that relief funds are rapidly channeled to affected regions when they are needed most.

Funds are accumulated through crowdfunding and held securely within the platform. Upon confirmation of a disaster event (like flooding) by Ambee’s API, 10% of the available funds are automatically distributed to a predefined list of verified Non-Profit Organization (NPO) Ethereum wallet addresses in the affected region. Moreover, we foster continuous support for these NPOs by redistributing 1% of the total fund pool to all listed charities on a monthly basis.
